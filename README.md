- `Flutter 3.0.0` or higher

- `Android SDK 23` or higher
- `Windows 10` or higher

## Setup

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installation is required in order to generate necessary bindings.

## Getting started

1. Create `noiseless` instance:

```dart
final noiseless = Noiseless.instance;
```

2. Use it to denoise an audio file:

```dart
await noiseless.denoiseFile(inputPathStr: 'assets/noise.wav', outputPathStr: 'assets/output.wav');
```

3. Or in real-time Flutter audio input via a `Stream`:

```dart
stream.listen((input) async {
  final result = await noiseless.denoiseChunk(input: input);
});
```


Note:  
*Doesn't changes introduced for 1.0.2 do not work when running in ebug*
*Workaround: use `flutter run --release` on physical devices*
